INTRODUCTION
------------

If you use Workbench Moderation, you'll soon find that Drupal core's 'Publish
content' and 'Unpublish content' actions don't work. This module replaces those
default actions with actions for each of your workbench moderation states,
enabling you to bulk set the workbench state of multiple nodes.

 For a full description of the module, visit the project page:
   https://drupal.org/project/workbench_moderation_actions

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following modules:

 * Workbench moderation (https://drupal.org/project/workbench_moderation)


INSTALLATION
------------
 
 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
   for further information.

   
CONFIGURATION
-------------
 
The module has no menu or modifiable settings. There is no configuration. When
enabled, the module will remove the 'Publish content' and 'Unpublish content'
actions and replace them with actions for each of your workbench moderation
states. You will see them in the "Actions" drop-down menu on the /admin/content
page.
